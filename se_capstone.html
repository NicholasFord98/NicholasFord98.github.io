  <p>
    Dungeon Explorer is a top-down turn-based ARPG developed using the Godot engine and GDScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main game loop is centered around excursions into the dungeon which reward the player with experience
    tokens that can be used to upgrade their character at the magic shop in the hub world.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this project I served as scrum master and developer as well as handling most of the git integration, high-level
    source code organization and testing.
